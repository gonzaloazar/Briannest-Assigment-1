             <p>
                 I really enjoy going to the beach, especially here in Maldonado, Uruguay where you can find one of 
                 the most beautiful ones.

            <p>
                Since I was little I remember having a passion for cars, for that reason here you have a photograph of a toyota Supra.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Programming is one of the most satisfying things for me, I have studied multiple lenguages and up
                until this day my passion keeps getting biger and biger.

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>
                College is a really fun thing for me, knowing that you are doing the career that you love is a pleassure 
                and also you can become a better human being.
